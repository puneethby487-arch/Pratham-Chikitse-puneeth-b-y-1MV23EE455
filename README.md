## 🎯 Project Overview
**Pratham Chikitse** is a comprehensive, life-saving Android application engineered to provide immediate, actionable first-aid guidance. Built entirely offline-first, the app acts as a pocket medical triage assistant, designed to work reliably in remote areas or low-connectivity zones.

By focusing on accessibility, the application includes a Voice-First mode, multi-language support, and an AI-powered triage chatbot to help users quickly identify the appropriate emergency response without needing internet connectivity.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **🚨 Interactive AI Triage Chatbot**: Parses user input locally and maps it to immediate, high-priority emergency guidelines and hospital recommendations.
- **🌐 Robust Multi-Language Support**: Seamlessly switch between English, Kannada, Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, and Tamil. The UI, backend data, and AI responses instantly adapt without requiring app restarts.
- **🔊 Voice-First & Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Built-in TTS engine reads out emergency instructions in the selected regional language, ensuring high accessibility for visually impaired users or chaotic emergency environments.
- **📴 Offline-First Architecture**: All guides, myths & facts, and triage logic are driven by localized JSON assets. No internet connection is ever required to fetch life-saving steps.
- **🏥 Geo-Spacial Hospital Locator**: Calculates nearest hospitals using offline boundary data when location permissions are granted.
- **🆘 SOS Mode**: Floating action button that provides immediate shortcuts to standard emergency numbers (108, 112, 100, 101) and custom emergency contacts.

## 📋 Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:
- **Android Studio**: Koala Feature Drop (2024.1.2) or newer.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: JDK 17 (Required for modern Gradle & Kotlin 2.0+).
- **Android SDK**: API Level 34 (Android 14) installed via SDK Manager.
- **Minimum Target Device**: Android 8.0 (API Level 26) or newer.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlphaDoc1/PrathamChikitse.git
cd PrathamChikitse
```

### Step 2: Open in Android Studio
1. Open **Android Studio**.
2. Click on **File > Open** (or **Open** from the welcome screen).
3. Select the `PrathamChikitse` root directory.
4. Allow Gradle a few moments to sync the project dependencies. 

### Step 3: Zero-Configuration Run
This project is built to be **plug-and-play**. Because it relies entirely on local JSON assets instead of complex backend databases:
- 🚫 **No API Keys Required**: You do not need to hunt for secrets or register for APIs.
- 🚫 **No Manual local.properties**: Android Studio will automatically generate your `local.properties` file with your specific SDK path during the first sync.
- ✅ **JDK Setup**: Just ensure your Java environment is set correctly. Go to `File > Settings` (or `Android Studio > Preferences` on Mac) > `Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle` and ensure the **Gradle JDK** is set to `jbr-17` or your installed JDK 17.

## 📱 Running the Application

### Using an Emulator
1. Open the **Device Manager** in Android Studio.
2. Create a new Virtual Device (e.g., Pixel 7) with System Image API 34.
3. Click the **Run** button (▶️) in the top toolbar.

### Using a Physical Device
1. Enable **Developer Options** on your Android device (Tap "Build Number" 7 times in Settings).
2. Enable **USB Debugging**.
3. Connect your device via USB (or Wireless Debugging).
4. Select your device from the deployment dropdown in Android Studio and click **Run**.

## 🌍 Data & Localization
All core application data is stored in localized JSON files within the `assets/` folder. This allows non-developers to easily contribute new emergency content or language translations.

### Adding a New Language
1. Add the language code to `LocaleHelper.kt` and the Settings UI options.
2. Create standard Android strings: `res/values-{lang}/strings.xml`.
3. Create localized JSON assets: e.g., `emergencies_{lang}.json`, `hospitals_{lang}.json`.
4. The internal `JsonDataSource` engine will automatically detect the active locale and fallback to English if a localized file is missing.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Potential Cause | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gradle Sync Failed (Unsupported class file major version)** | Incorrect JDK version. | Change Gradle JDK to Java 17 in Settings. |
| **Text-to-Speech is silent** | Missing TTS Engine on device. | Ensure Google TTS is installed and updated from the Play Store. The app will gracefully fall back to English if the chosen language pack isn't downloaded. |
| **Double spacing above Top App Bar** | Inset/Edge-to-Edge collision. | Fixed in recent commit. Ensure you've pulled the latest branch utilizing `.consumeWindowInsets()` in the NavGraph. |
| **"Unresolved reference: hiltViewModel"** | Hilt KAPT/KSP issue. | Run `Build > Clean Project`, then `Rebuild Project`. |
